  Author runnable workflow scripts for Claude Code's Workflow tool — deterministic
  JavaScript files that fan out fresh-context subagents under plain control flow.
  Use when the user wants to create, scaffold, or fix a workflow, or author/edit a
  .js file under .claude/workflows/: "make a workflow", "create a workflow for X",
  "turn this into a workflow", "scaffold a multi-agent pipeline". NOT for merely
  running an existing workflow, or a one-off single-subagent task.

# Workflow Creator

Turn a goal into a **runnable workflow file** — a JavaScript orchestrator for
Claude Code's `Workflow` tool.

A workflow fans work out to fresh-context subagents under **deterministic
JavaScript** control flow: the loops, the conditionals, the fan-out are plain
code, and only the leaf `agent()` calls spend model tokens. The Workflow tool is
new and undocumented, so this skill carries the format, the judgment calls, and a
tested authoring procedure. Use it to write a new workflow, convert a multi-step
job into one, fix a broken script, or explain the format — the `meta` block,
`agent()`/`parallel()`/`pipeline()`/`phase()`, schemas, the determinism rules —
when the user is confused about workflows or a workflow errors.

The deep material lives in two reference files — read them when the step says so:

- `references/api-reference.md` — the complete manual: every global, every option,
  every cap and constant, what happens at each limit.
- `references/patterns.md` — copy-paste orchestration patterns (fan-out, pipeline,
  loop-until-budget, adversarial verify, judge panel, nested workflow).

Starter files are in `assets/templates/`. Six complete, runnable example
workflows are in `assets/examples/` — `assets/examples/README.md` maps each one
to a topology and to the model / structured-output techniques it shows. A linter
is in `scripts/`.

---

## Stability

This skill is pinned to **Claude Code 2.1.149** — the binary against which the
Workflow tool's internals (globals, caps, journal format) were last verified.
Two gates control runtime availability:

- **`CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1`** (env var, user-controlled). See Step 0.
- **`tengu_workflows_enabled`** (Statsig flag, account-controlled). Even with
  the env var set, the tool stays hidden if the flag is off for the user's
  account — surface that possibility if `/workflows` does nothing after the
  export.

**Break-glass.** If a global, cap, or option in `references/api-reference.md`
does not match a runtime error, re-read the manual section and verify via a
one-line `Workflow({ scriptPath })` smoke test against a known-good script — do
not invent behaviour. After a Claude Code upgrade, expect the version pin to
trail the binary until this section is updated.

## Step 0 — Confirm the Workflow tool is available

A workflow can only **run** if the Workflow tool is enabled. It is **off by
default**, gated behind an environment variable. The file is always worth
*writing* — check this so the user hears the truth about *running* it:

```bash
echo "${CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS:-<not set>}"
```

If it is not set, the workflow file is still worth writing — but tell the user
they must enable the tool before it will run, either of:

```bash
# per session
export CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1 && claude
```

```jsonc
// or persistently, in .claude/settings.local.json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS": "1" } }
```

Workflow files live in `.claude/workflows/<name>.js` (project-local) or
`~/.claude/workflows/<name>.js` (global). The filename is not the workflow name —
the `name` inside the `meta` block is.

---

## Step 1 — Decide whether a workflow is even the right tool

Do not reach for a workflow by default — it is the heaviest option and it is
gated for a reason (it can spend a lot of tokens). Pick deliberately:

| The job | Right tool |
|---|---|
| One subagent, one task | The plain **`Agent`** tool — no workflow |
| A reusable procedure where **Claude** picks the steps each run | A **Skill** |
| Many subagents in a **fixed** shape (fan-out / pipeline / loop), same every run, worth resuming | A **Workflow** ✅ |

A workflow earns its cost when **all** of these are true: the work is parallel or
multi-stage; the orchestration must be deterministic and resumable; and
isolating each step in its own fresh context window is an advantage. When
unsure, say so and offer the lighter option instead.

---

## Step 2 — Find the shape of the job

Before writing a line of code, answer these — the answers pick the topology.

1. **What is the unit of work?** The thing one subagent does once — review one
   file, research one question, draft one platform. Name it concretely.
2. **How many units, and is the count known up front?** A known list → map over
   it. An unknown count (discovery, "find all the bugs") → a loop.
3. **What is the topology?**
   - Independent units, one pass each → **fan-out**.
   - Units flow through ordered stages (review → verify) → **pipeline**.
   - Keep going until a target count or a budget runs low → **loop**.
4. **Does any later step need *all* the earlier results at once** — to dedup,
   merge, count, or early-exit on a zero total? If yes, that needs a **barrier**.
   If no, it does not — prefer `pipeline`.
5. **Does a step need structured data back** (not free text)? Then that
   `agent()` call needs a `schema`.

Write these five answers down for the user before coding. They are the design.

---

## Step 3 — The decision that matters most: `pipeline` vs `parallel`

This is the call people get wrong, so make it explicitly.

- **`pipeline(items, stage1, stage2, …)` is the default for multi-stage work.**
  Each item flows through every stage on its own — **there is no barrier between
  stages**. Item A can be in stage 3 while item B is still in stage 1.
  Wall-clock = the slowest single item's whole chain, not the sum of the slowest
  stage at each step.

- **`parallel(thunks)` is a barrier.** It waits for every task before returning.
  Reach for it **only** when a stage genuinely needs the *entire* previous
  result set in hand — dedup across all findings, merge, a count-based
  early-exit. "It is cleaner code" or "the stages feel separate" are **not**
  reasons — a pipeline models separate stages fine.

Smell test: writing `const a = await parallel(...)`, then a plain
transform (`flat`/`map`/`filter`) with no cross-item dependency, then another
`parallel(...)` — that middle transform does not need the barrier. Make it a
pipeline stage instead. **When in doubt, `pipeline`.**

---

## Step 4 — Write the file

A workflow file has exactly two parts, in this order. The parser is strict.

### Part 1 — the `meta` block (must be the very first statement)

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'review-changes',                         // required, non-empty
  description: 'Review changed files, verify each finding', // required — shown in the permission dialog
  whenToUse: 'Before shipping a branch',          // optional — shown in the workflow list
  phases: [                                       // optional — one entry per phase() call
    { title: 'Review' },
    { title: 'Verify', model: 'haiku' },
  ],
}
```

`meta` **must be a pure literal** — no variables, function calls, spreads, or
template strings inside it. Build dynamic values in the body, never in `meta`.
Use the same phase `title` strings in `meta.phases` as in the `phase()` calls.

### Part 2 — the body (async JavaScript)

Everything after `meta` is the body. It runs inside an `async` function — `await`
at the top level. A fixed set of globals is injected; **import nothing**:
`agent`, `pipeline`, `parallel`, `phase`, `log`, `console`, `budget`, `args`,
`workflow` (plus an injected `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` pair). The body's
`return` value becomes the tool result handed back to Claude.

**Read `references/api-reference.md` §5 now** for every global's full signature
and the `args` normalizer. The one trap to remember inline: `args` arrives
**exactly as passed** — an object stays an object, a string stays a string,
nothing passed is `undefined` — so never call `JSON.parse(args)` unconditionally;
parse only when `typeof args === 'string'`.

### Setting a model, and getting structured data back — the two `agent()` opts to tune most

**Model — `agent(prompt, { model })`.** Each agent call runs on its own model.
Accepts `'haiku'`, `'sonnet'`, `'opus'`, `'inherit'`, or a full model ID; omit it
and the agent inherits the session's model. Drop **cheap, high-volume,
mechanical** leaf work (per-item summaries, refute-this checks, classification)
to `'haiku'`; leave judgement-heavy work on the inherited model. Two cautions:

- **There is no validation.** A typo (`'hauku'`) is not rejected — it is passed
  through and the agent fails later. Spell the alias exactly.
- **`model` on a `meta.phases[]` entry does nothing at runtime** — it is a label
  for the permission dialog only. The model is set *solely* by the `model` opt on
  the `agent()` call. For a Haiku phase, set `model` in *both* places: the phase
  entry (honest dialog) and every `agent()` call in it (actual effect).

**Structured output — `agent(prompt, { schema })`.** Without `schema`, the call
returns the agent's final text as a **string**. Pass a JSON Schema and the agent is
*forced* to return a **validated object** matching it — the runtime builds a hidden
`StructuredOutput` tool from the schema, AJV-validates the result, and makes the
agent retry on a mismatch. `agent()` returns the parsed object directly — no
`JSON.parse`. Use `schema` for any result a later line of JavaScript reads a
field off of; keep schemas small and `required`-tight. To pass data *between*
stages, stringify it into the next prompt (`JSON.stringify`) — the orchestrator
shares no memory with the subagent, only the prompt text.

For full signatures, every option, and every cap, **read
`references/api-reference.md` now.** For ready-made orchestration shapes, **read
`references/patterns.md`** and copy the one that fits Step 2's answers. Or start
from a file in `assets/templates/`, or adapt a full worked example from
`assets/examples/` (its `README.md` says which one fits).

---

## Step 5 — Validate before running

Catch the parser's hard rules before wasting a run. Use the bundled linter:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate-workflow.mjs <path-to-file.js>
```

It flags: missing or non-first `meta`, a non-literal `meta`, a missing
`name`/`description`, banned non-deterministic calls, and an oversized script.
Fix every error it reports before invoking the workflow.

---

## Step 6 — Run, watch, iterate

Run a named workflow with `Workflow({ name: 'review-changes' })`, or a file with
`Workflow({ scriptPath: '…' })`. It runs in the **background** — the call returns
a run ID immediately and a `<task-notification>` arrives on completion. Watch it
live with the `/workflows` command, which can also skip or retry a single
agent mid-run.

To iterate: **edit the saved file**, then re-invoke with
`Workflow({ scriptPath, resumeFromRunId })`. Every `agent()` call before the
first edit replays instantly from cache; only the changed call and everything
after it re-runs. Same script + same args = a 100% cache hit. Never re-paste the
whole script after the first run — edit the file.

---

## Gotchas — check every one before handing over the file

These are the mistakes that actually break workflows:

- **Determinism bans.** `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, and argless `new Date()`
  **throw** inside a workflow — they would break resume. Pass timestamps in via
  `args` and stamp results *after* the workflow returns; vary "randomness" by
  loop index instead. `new Date(specificValue)` is fine.
- **No filesystem, no Node APIs** in the orchestrator. No `require`, `fs`,
  `process`. Any file read/write/Bash work belongs **inside an `agent()`** — the
  subagent has the normal tools; the orchestrator does not.
- **`parallel()` takes thunks, not promises.** It must be
  `[() => agent(...), () => agent(...)]`, never `[agent(...), agent(...)]`. Bare
  calls start immediately and defeat the concurrency limiter.
- **Always `.filter(Boolean)`.** `parallel()` and `pipeline()` put `null` in the
  slot of any item that threw, was skipped, or was dropped by the budget. The
  result arrays have holes by design.
- **`meta` is a pure literal and the first statement.** No dynamic values, no
  code before it.
- **Open-ended loops need a hard stop** — a counter (`while (found < 10)`) or a
  budget guard (`while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > 50_000)`). With no
  budget set, `budget.remaining()` is `Infinity`; an unguarded loop sprints into
  the 1000-agent lifetime cap and throws.
- **`isolation: 'worktree'` is expensive** (~200–500 ms + disk per agent). Use it
  only when parallel agents mutate files and would otherwise collide.

## Worked example — review a branch, verify each finding

The canonical worked example is `assets/examples/review-branch.js`: fan out one
reviewer per dimension, then — the instant a dimension's review returns — fan out
a verifier per finding. Read it next to `assets/examples/README.md`, which maps
it to its topology and the model / structured-output techniques it demonstrates.

It uses `pipeline` rather than `parallel` on purpose: a finding should verify the
moment *its own* review is done, so dimension `bugs` can be verifying while `perf`
is still under review — no waiting for the slowest dimension, each agent reasons
from a clean context, and the orchestrator JavaScript spends zero model tokens.

---

## When the user wants to learn, not just get a file

If the request is "explain how workflows work" rather than "build me one", walk
them through `references/api-reference.md` — it is written to be read top to
bottom as the missing manual. Then offer to scaffold their first workflow from a
template so they have something runnable to poke at.
